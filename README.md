Partial differential equations (PDEs) are essential components for modelling different processes and systems in various scientific and engineering areas. To predict the behavior of a certain system, one needs to solve or simulate the PDEs that describe that system. However, obtaining an analytical solution to PDEs is a difficult task in most practical situations, especially in the case of nonlinear or high dimensional PDEs. Due to the rapid evolution and advancements in the field of deep learning, researchers are starting to use deep neural networks (DNN) to approximate the solution of PDEs. Different models have been developed to perform this task such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Neural Operator. The speed and the efficiency of these models can surpass other common solvers such as Finite Elements (FM), Finite Difference (FD), and spectral methods in certain cases. In this project, we will utilize these deep learning models to solve an industry-related problem that requires PDEs approximation and compare the accuracy of the used method against experimental or simulated data obtained through other available solvers.
